# Focus: A SOFTENG 702 Project
## Brief
In this project, a browser extension is built that can monitor and manage the user's personal online time and use of websites. Concepts of this kind, with various levels of strictness exist. Focus in this project is on addressing personal interest to limit or keep track of one's own online usage, so in this project no sharing of data, no hard locks. It should be investigated in the literature: how can the problem be addressed with such a system, what do we know about the evidence of success, what features do people want. A related aspect that can be more or less emphasized is: how can positive use be made of such activities as work break reminders and mental relaxation or stimulus.

## Project Goal
To create an application where the user can easily visualise their internet usage. By allowing them to track their top applications, we are providing them with the ability to be self-aware and self-reflect. The proposed project will have an effective UI to visualise their usage. This will give them real-time feedback over allocated monthly periods. This goal is combined with work-break reminders. Our application ensures the user still has complete control over their own productivity and how they spend their time, but motivates them by providing them with a full work breakdown.

The overall goal for our project is to deploy motivational strategies to allow users to stick to long term pre-determined targets, rather than short term distractions. This is done by providing a users with a useful visualisation of their time spent online, to allow them to better understand their usage.

## Research Question
How can a user effectively limit and/or keep track of their internet usage over a certain amount of time?
